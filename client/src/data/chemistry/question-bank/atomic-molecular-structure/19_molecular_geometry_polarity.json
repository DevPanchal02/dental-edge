      "concept_text": "Option A. The electronegativity difference between atoms Incorrect. The electronegativity difference between atoms determines whether or not a bond is polar. The polarity of these bonds, along with molecular geometry, then determines the overall polarity of a covalent molecule. Option B. The hybridization of the central atom Incorrect. The hybridization of the central atom dictates whether or not polar bonds cancel out, as well as whether or not lone pairs exist to cause polarity in a covalent molecule. Option C. The molecular geometry of the molecule Incorrect. The molecular geometry of the molecule dictates whether or not polar bonds cancel out, as well as whether or not lone pairs exist to cause polarity in a covalent molecule. Option D. The number of lone pairs on the central atom Incorrect. The number of lone pairs on the central atom can affect the way polar bonds are oriented in a molecule. For example, in NH 3 , the presence of a lone pair results in an imbalance in polarity, resulting in an overall polar molecule. Option E. The weight of the atoms in a covalent bond Correct. Of all the factors given, the weight of the atoms in a covalent bond plays an insignificant role in determining the polarity of a covalent bond. Rather, it is the electronegativity difference between atoms that plays a more direct role. Therefore, the answer is E .",

In both cases, O is more electronegative. STEP 2: Next, we draw out the Lewis structures of both CO 2 and H 2 O: STEP 3: When analyzing their molecular geometries: the central atom in CO 2 has sp hybridization and has a linear molecular geometry. Meanwhile, the central atom in H 2 O has sp 3 hybridization and has a bent molecular geometry. Based on this, the polar bonds in CO 2 cancel out, resulting in an overall nonpolar molecule. Meanwhile, the polar bonds in H 2 O do not cancel out, resulting in an overall polar molecule. Therefore, we can say that H 2 O is polar, and CO 2 is nonpolar because CO 2 is linear, H 2 O is not linear . Option D is incorrect because CO 2 contains bonds that cancel out dipoles, not reinforce dipoles. Therefore, the answer is B .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving molecular geometry polarity , we will individually analyze each scenario I., II., and III. STEP 1: First, we compare the polarity of HO and HF. Since F is more electronegative than O (electronegativity increases going up and right in the periodic table), the H-F bond will be more polar than the H-O bond. Therefore, HF is more polar. STEP 2: Next, we compare the polarity in CH 4 and CH 2 Cl 2 . Since the C-Cl bond is polar and the C-H bond is nonpolar, the presence of the 2 Cl in CH 2 Cl 2 makes the molecular more polar than CH 4 . The polar bonds do not cancel out in CH 2 Cl 2 , so CH 2 Cl 2 is more polar. STEP 3: Finally, we compare the polarity of CO 2 and HCl. Although the C-O bond in CO 2 is polar, CO 2 ’s linear molecular geometry results in the dipoles canceling out, so CO 2 is nonpolar. Meanwhile, HCl is polar and linear, but does not contain any dipoles canceling out, so HCl is more polar. Therefore, the answer is A .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving molecular geometry polarity , we need to take a closer look at the molecular geometry of an XeF­ 2 molecule. STEP 1: First, we determine that XeF 2 has 8 + 2(7) = 22 valence electrons, which allows us to draw the following Lewis structure: STEP 2: Since XeF 2 has 5 electron groups, 2 of which are bonding pairs and 3 of which are lone pairs, we know that XeF 2 has a linear molecular geometry. Feel free to use the table below as a refresher and remember to memorize this prior to your exam: STEP 3: Because Xe and F has a significant electronegativity difference, the Xe-F bond is polar. However, because of its polar molecular geometry of the XeF 2 molecule, the two polar bonds cancel out and result in an overall nonpolar molecule. In this case, we can say XeF 2 is nonpolar due to its symmetrical linear geometry . Therefore, the answer is E .",

      "concept_text": "To solve this problem involving molecular geometry , we need to discuss the molecular structures of both NH 3 and NF 3 , in order to understand the polarity differences. First, we note that both NH 3 and NF 3 have similar trigonal pyramidal molecular geometries – this is because they both have 4 electron groups, 3 of which are bonding pairs, and 1 of which is  a lone pair: In addition, both N-H and N-F bonds are polar. Since N has a higher electronegativity than H, the N-H bond distributes its electrons closer to the N. Since F has a higher electronegativity than N, the N-F bond distributes its electrons closer to the F: In the case of NH 3 , the lone pair dipole is in the same direction as the resultant dipole of the 3 N-H bonds. Meanwhile, in the case of NF 3 , the lone pair dipole is in the opposite direction of the resultant dipole of the 3 N-F bonds. The lone pair dipole decreases the effect of the 3 N-F bond moments, which results in the low dipole moment of NF 3 . The lone pair contribution in NH 3 reinforces the dipole but in NF 3 the dipoles oppose the effect of the lone pair. Therefore we can conclude that NH 3 is more polar than NF 3 . Therefore, the answer is A.",

This is because the molecular geometry will cancel out all dipoles, resulting in an overall nonpolar molecule. Meanwhile, a molecule like a square pyramidal molecule (Option C) contains lone pairs. This implies that the dipoles will not all cancel out, and may result in unbalanced electron distribution, resulting in a polar molecule. The net dipole will likely point towards the lone pair, which will exert a great electron pull. The rest of the options are molecular structures that only contain bonding pairs, which suggest that they cannot be polar, assuming all outer atoms are identical. Therefore, the answer is C.",
